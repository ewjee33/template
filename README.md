Template
A robust backend API built with TypeScript and Nest.js for managing [your domain, e.g., user data, inventory, etc.].

Overview
This project is a TypeScript-based backend application designed with scalability, type safety, and maintainability in mind. It leverages modern development practices to ensure smooth collaboration and deployment.

Key Features
Base Controller/Service: A reusable base layer for all model-specific controllers and services, promoting DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles.
DTOs for Filtering: Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to handle input validation and filtering, ensuring clean and secure data handling.
Logging Middleware: Custom middleware to log requests, including response times, for performance monitoring and debugging.
AllExceptionFilters: Global exception filters to gracefully handle errors thrown by controllers, providing consistent error responses.
Type Safety: Configured with noImplicitAny and strictNullChecks in TypeScript for stronger type security and fewer runtime errors.

Development Notes
TypeScript Config: The tsconfig.json enforces noImplicitAny and strictNullChecks for better type safety. Update types as needed when extending controllers or services.
Logging: Response times are logged via middleware. Check logs in <log-location> for details.
Error Handling: Use AllExceptionFilters to catch and format controller exceptions consistently.
